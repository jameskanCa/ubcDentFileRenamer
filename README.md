# ubcDentFileRenamer
Application Written for UBC Dentistry. Program designed to rename 1000+ patient records. Developed outside of work time to help simplify and speed up the renaming process of dental patient records and casts records in a secure local manner. The program takes the files and renames all items placed inside of the "Rename" folder according to record type, and places them inside of folders that the program makes will create in the background in accordance to the standard naming procedures used by Faculty of Dentistry at UBC. This project is currently still being used by the faculty's WorkLearn positions and has been integrated as the primary means of completing the job of record digitalization.
